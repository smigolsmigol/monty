# The Python Subset

Monty is not a Python implementation aiming for completeness.
It implements enough Python for a model to express what it wants to do, and deliberately stops there.
Everything it does implement is meant to behave exactly like CPython 3.14; everywhere it does not, the divergence is
written down.

This page gives you the shape of the subset.
The exhaustive, per-feature list lives in [`limitations/`](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/tree/main/limitations) in
the repository, and that directory — not this page — is the source of truth.

!!! tip
    Turn on [type checking](type-checking.md) rather than memorising this page.
    Unsupported APIs generally fail before they run; see [the caveats](type-checking.md#caveats) for the exceptions.

## Language features

**Supported:**

- `def`, `async def`, nested functions, closures, `lambda`
- Decorators on functions and classes
- Simple classes: instance methods, `__init__`, `__repr__`/`__str__`, `__eq__`/`__hash__`, `__iter__`/`__next__`,
  `__contains__`, class variables
- `@dataclass`, including the `eq=` and `frozen=` options, and host dataclass instances passed in and out
- List, dict and set comprehensions
- `try` / `except` / `else` / `finally`, `raise ... from ...`
- `for`, `while`, `if` / `elif` / `else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, `assert`, `global`, `nonlocal`, `return`
- `with` statements, for files and for classes implementing `__enter__` / `__exit__`
- f-strings (including the `=` debug form) and `str.format()`, with `!r` / `!s` / `!a`
  conversions, format specs, and nested replacement fields
- `async` / `await`, and `asyncio.run` / `asyncio.gather`
- `import x`, `import x.y`, `from x import y, z as w`
- Starred unpacking everywhere CPython allows it

**Rejected at parse time**, with `NotImplementedError` before any code runs:

- Class inheritance and metaclasses (`class Foo(Bar):`)
- Decorators on methods — so no `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`, `@property`
- `yield` / `yield from` — there are no generator functions.
  Generator *expressions* parse, but currently materialise to a `list`
- `match` statements
- `del`, both `del x` and `del d[k]`
- `try*` / `except*` exception groups
- PEP 695 `type` aliases
- `async with`, `async for` and async comprehensions
- Wildcard imports (`from m import *`)
- Complex literals (`1j`) and t-strings

**Missing in other ways:**

- User-defined exception classes.
  The built-in exception types are a fixed set, and without inheritance you cannot add to it.
- Function attributes.
  `fn.__name__`, `fn.__doc__` and friends raise `AttributeError`, and new attributes cannot be set — so
  `functools.wraps`-style metadata copying and registries keyed on `fn.__name__` have no equivalent.
- `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `globals`, `locals`, `__import__` and `super` — all raise `NameError`.
- Third-party packages.
  There is no `sys.path` and no site-packages.

## Standard library

The following modules are present:

| Module | Divergences |
| --- | --- |
| `asyncio` | [asyncio.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/asyncio.md) |
| `base64` | [base64.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/base64.md) |
| `binascii` | [base64.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/base64.md) |
| `collections` | [collections.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/collections.md) |
| `dataclasses` | [dataclasses.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/dataclasses.md) |
| `datetime` | [datetime.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/datetime.md) |

| `sys` | [sys.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/sys.md) |
| `typing` | [typing.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/typing.md) |
| `unicodedata` | [unicodedata.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/unicodedata.md) |

Each covers only part of its CPython surface — often a small part.
The absent names are missing from the module namespace rather than stubbed, so they fail type checking as well as
raising `AttributeError` at runtime.

Notably absent: `enum`, `contextlib`, `random`, `time`, `io`, `copy`, `string`, `struct`, `operator`,
`inspect`, `logging`, `traceback`, `hashlib`, `uuid`, `urllib`.
Some of those are absent by design — `socket`, `subprocess`, `multiprocessing`, `threading` and `ctypes` would breach
the sandbox — and others are simply not implemented yet.

The authoritative list is
[`limitations/modules.md`](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/modules.md).

## Things that work but not quite like CPython

A few divergences are worth knowing up front because they change how code behaves rather than whether it runs.
Each links to the `limitations/` file that owns it, which is where the full account lives:

- **`assert` failures get pytest-style messages.** `assert 2 == 5` raises `AssertionError: assert 2 == 5`, not CPython's
  empty `AssertionError`.
  Turn it off with `assert_message_annotations=False` on `checkout()`
  ([assert.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/assert.md)).
- **`enumerate`, `zip`, `map`, `filter` and `reversed` are eager**, not lazy.
  So `map(f, itertools.count())` runs until a resource limit trips
  ([builtins.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/builtins.md)).
- **`re` is backed by Rust's `fancy-regex`**, not CPython's engine: no `bytes` patterns, no `VERBOSE` flag, and some
  error messages differ ([re.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/re.md)).
- **There is no event loop inside the sandbox.** `async` / `await` work, and `asyncio` exposes exactly two functions:
  `run` and `gather`, the latter running host calls concurrently.
  `create_task`, `sleep` and everything else do not exist
  ([asyncio.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/asyncio.md)).
- **`str.format_map()`, the `format()` builtin and `%`-formatting are not implemented.**
  `str.format()` and f-strings are supported
  ([format.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/format.md)).
- **Only UTF-8, ASCII, UTF-16 and UTF-32 codecs exist.** `latin-1` and friends raise `LookupError`
  ([encoding.md](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/encoding.md)).

## How to go deeper

For a specific feature, open the `limitations/` file named after the builtin, module or construct.
If you hit something that is neither in the subset nor in `limitations/`, [open an
issue](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/issues).
